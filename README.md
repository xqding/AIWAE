## Annealed Importance Weighted Auto-Encoders (AIWAE)

This repository is part of the paper [Improving Importance Weighted Auto-Encoders with Annealed Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04904) proposing AIWAE by Xinqiang Ding and David J. Freedman.

The repository includes both the datasets and source code that reproduce the results presented in the above paper.
It also includes code for calculating marginal probability density of samples using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
